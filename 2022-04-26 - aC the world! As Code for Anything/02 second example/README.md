# Dynamically generated Dynamic Distribution Lists

Company has 20+ regions, each of which need their own dynamic distribution lists based on region. The company is growing and the filters will occasionally change.

## Before aCing

This was not reasonably possible without unnecessary finger grease.

## After aCing

Adding in additional DDLs per region or tweaking existing DDLs requires a simple config update and a PR.
